## Replace Screencap

This site and repository is dedicated to the basic idea that sharing content using screen captures / shots sucks.  Content that previously had structure and (somewhat) rich information is reduced to an image, and that means things like incompatibility with screen readers (and thus inaccesibility for blind people) unless someone takes the time to manually retype any text, inability to do text searches, posts / threads / conversations awkwardly broken into separate images, links that don't work (or really, aren't links at all any more, but look like them), and so on.

### Why?

Because it's annyoying, limiting, and I believe we can do better.

### How?

As von Moltke said<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, no plan survives contact with the enemy.  However, here are the main steps as I currently imagine them:

  1. Identify the advantages (relative to what?) of sharing by screencap, and how/why it became so common.
  2. Identify the kinds of information (including appearance) that users would like to see included in a better "screenshot."
  3. Develop a (first draft) format that captures the users' needs, including underlying application needs associated with capturing, sharing, and displaying them.
  4. Identify and head-off (as much as possible) application developers' potential objections
    a. And identify what can be done without the involvement of the application developers
  5. Push, network, cajole, cooperate with, etc. application developers to get this functionality integrated.

## What is this site?

This web page is part of a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ewa/replace-screencap/) for the project.  This page is not editable (unless you have write access to the code repository), but there is a [replace-screencap wiki](https://github.com/ewa/replace-screencap/wiki) that is meant to be editable by anyone.  If you're interested in any of this, go to the wiki and start adding ideas.
